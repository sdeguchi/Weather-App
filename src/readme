Unzip the Program2 zip and extract the 'src' directory to your preferred location. 
Open a terminal window and change directory into the 'src' directory that has just been extracted. 

Run the following commands to compile all the source code, and then execute the weather application:
./p2.sh
java WeatherGUI

If p2.sh is not executable run:
sudo chmod +x p2.sh
And type your password to make it an executable.

p2.sh contains the javac command that will compile all the source code and the needed jar files.
